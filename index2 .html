      <p> I choose the children's book "Grandma Mcgarvey paints the shed" by Jenny Hessel, illustrated by Trevor Pye due to the bright colours and the busy design. The book is very quirky and fun which I wanted to show in my website. I used the bright colour scheme and interesting shapes to make my website vibrant and fun. I wanted it to be interactive for both children and parents which is why I added a noughts and crosses game into it so that viewers would be drawn in to play. My website has a lot of different elements and movement which hopefully will cause viewers to want to take a look around which in return will have them wanting to read the book.
